{"name":"Yolothre.at","tagline":"Now you can download a Threat Intelligence!","body":"YoloThreat is a new Cyber Threat Intelligence startup conceived, created, coming out of stealth, funded, ran out of runway, and liquidated at the SANS Cyber Threat Intelligence Summit in 2015. We were going to create a new and innovative infrastructure for threat intelligence teams by ripping off a ton of open source projects, so now we're open sourcing our abuse of open source. \r\n\r\n### Management Team\r\n\r\n#### Kyle \"The Silver Haired Wombat\" Maxwell - CEO\r\n\r\n- @kylemaxwell\r\n- github.com/technoskald\r\n- techoskald.github.io\r\n\r\n#### Scott \"He Doesn't Like Anything\" Roberts - VP of Engineering & Gummy Bears\r\n\r\n- @sroberts\r\n- github.com/sroberts\r\n- sroberts.github.io\r\n\r\n#### Alex \"The Capricious Capybara\" Pinto - Chief Big Data Analytics Machine Learning Savant \r\n\r\n### The YoloThreat Platform\r\nWe were going to develop a whole platform... but we were lazy. It turns out there are 3 big things new threat intel teams need to be able to do: collect data, analyze malware, monitor maliciousness on the internet, and store it all for later.\r\n\r\nTo that end YoloThreat has borrowed (mostly) & created (only when absolutely necessary) a number of Docker containers for common threat intelligence tools:\r\n- [Maltrieve](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/technoskald/maltrieve/)\r\n- [Combine](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/technoskald/combine/)\r\n- [Scumblr](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bprodoehl/scumblr/)\r\n- [CRITs](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/pnelson/crits/)\r\n- [MISP](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/eg5846/misp-docker/)\r\n- [ELK](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/qnib/elk/)\r\n- [Viper](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/remnux/viper/)\r\n- [Thug](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/remnux/thug/)\r\n\r\n### Sales\r\nWe would be happy to sell you all these free & open source projects, even the ones that aren't ours. Feel free to send money to us. If you can't find us clearly your threat intelligence game isn't that strong. \r\n\r\n### Legal Stuff\r\nWe lied... you still can't really download a Threat Intelligence.
